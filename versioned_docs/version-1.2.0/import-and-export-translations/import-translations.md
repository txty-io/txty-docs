You should now have a project set up with at least one language. We will now import your translations. To do this click on `Import` in the left sidebar. If you are starting a new project and don't have any translation files to import you can skip this step and create keys manually by reading more [here](/manage-your-translations/add-keys).

Select the language for which you are uploading the translations, select a file format and then drop your file with your translations.

<!-- Currently the following formats for importing translations are supported:

- JSON Flat (with format `<key>: <translation>`)
- JSON Format.js (with format `<key>: { defaultMessage: "<message>", description: "<description>" }`)
- iOS .strings files -->

:::info

We are allways working on adding further import formats. If you are missing a format you need please just create a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/texterify/texterify/issues) or send us an email to <support@texterify.com>.

Then click on `Import file` to upload your translations. Repeat this process for all your language translation files.

After the Import has finished click on `Keys` in the left sidebar to see all your imported keys and translations.
