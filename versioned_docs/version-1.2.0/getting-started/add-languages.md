title: Add languages
---

Before you can import your translations you must first add some languages to your project. Go to the languages site by clicking on `Languages` in the left sidebar.

Then click on `Create language` and enter the information of the language you want to add. Texterify does not limit you to certain languages. Freely combine language and country codes to target any group of people in every area of the world. You must at least give a language a name. If you also specify a country you will see flags anywhere in the app for the language.

By clicking on `Default language` you mark the language as the default language in which you are developing your software. This for example enables custom export settings of which you will learn later more about.

Then click `Create language` to create a new language.
