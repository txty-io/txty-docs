We can't say it often enough how important feedback is to us, so we can make the localization process as easy as possible. If you ever miss a feature or have problems with something just create a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/texterify/texterify/issues) or send us an email to <support@texterify.com>. We are here to help and look forward to your feedback.

If you want to further support the development of Texterify make sure to check out the [Texterify repository](https://github.com/texterify/texterify).

Thank you!
