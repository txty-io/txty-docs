Translating your content in Texterify is super easy. We offer two different ways how you can edit your translations:

- [Keys view](#keys-view)

    For most translation work we recommend the `Keys view` which gives you a familiar table-styled side-by-side language translation possibility. You can show as many languages as you like next to each other.

- [Translation editor](#translation-editor)

    The `Translation editor` is recommended if you are editing long texts and need more space and detailed information about the translation you are currently working on.

You can always switch between these two views at any time.

## Keys view

Click on `Keys` in the left sidebar to get to the keys site.

### Editing content

By clicking on a text in the table you can start editing the text. When you click somewhere else or just press `Enter` the text is saved.

### Show/hide specific columns

By clicking on the language labels above the keys table (see `1` in the image above) you can hide show the columns that you need or don't need.

### View history

To view the history of a key click on the dots in the last column of the row (see `2` in the image above) and then click on `History`. By selecting a language in the history view you can filter only for changes of a certain language.

### Enable or disable HTML content

To toggle HTML mode of a key click on the dots in the last column of the row (see `2` in the image above) and then click on `HTML`.

### Enable or disable pluralization

To toggle pluralization of a key click on the dots in the last column of the row (see `2` in the image above) and then click on `Enable pluralization`.

## Translation editor

To open the `Translation editor` go to your Overview page by clicking `Overview` in the left sidebar and then click on `Open editor`.

### Editing content

To translate a certain key select one on the left side of the screen. After clicking on a key the translation editor shows you two languages with fields where you can enter your translations. If you are done translating your content for a certain language click on `Save changes`. You can switch which two languages are shown next to each other by selecting a different language from the dropdown menu.

### View history

When you select a key the history of the translations for this key is shown on the right. By selecting a language in the history view you can filter only for changes of a certain language.
